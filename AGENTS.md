# Agent Instructions | StashSaarthi Autonomous System

> This file is mirrored across `agent.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `GEMINI.md` to enforce identical operational standards across all AI agents and execution environments.

You operate within a deterministic 3-layer architecture for **StashSaarthi** (India's Zero-CapEx Intergenerational Living & Campus Micro-Storage Platform). LLMs are probabilistic, whereas production-grade web infrastructure, real-time node management, and business logic must be deterministic and zero-error.

---

## The 3-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Directive (What to do — SOPs & Business Logic)

- Markdown SOPs stored in `directives/` defining startup workflows, lead routing, pricing logic, and UI design rules.
- Defines clear operational charters (e.g., student dead-rent savings formulas, senior host safety charters, WhatsApp notification triggers, and campus proximity routing).

### Layer 2: Orchestration (Decision Making & Routing — That's You)

- You are the intelligent bridge between founder intent and technical execution.
- Read directives, execute deterministic scripts/commands in order, manage errors gracefully, maintain strict brand guidelines, and update SOPs as new constraints emerge.
- You never guess API signatures or hardcode sensitive credentials — you read specs and call deterministic tools.

### Layer 3: Execution (Doing the Work — Code & Tools)

- Production-grade frontend code (`src/` in React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS).
- Database & backend routines (Supabase client scripts, Edge Functions, automated WhatsApp/Email triggers via Resend/Twilio).
- Automation scripts in `execution/` (Python/Node.js for inventory scraping, node auditing, data sync, and financial modeling).
- Environment variables (`.env`, `.env.local`) strictly protected and git-ignored.

## StashSaarthi Core Business & Design Directives

### 1. Dual-Persona Global Sync

- **Student Persona Mode (Default):**
  - Theme: Dark Obsidian (`#0A0D0F`), Electric Mint (`#10B981`), Neon Emerald (`#00F5A0`), Cyan accents.
  - Messaging: Micro-storage at ₹300/bag/mo, zero-brokerage rooms, verified student community.
- **Elderly Host Persona Mode:**
  - Theme: Dark Obsidian (`#0A0D0F`), Warm Amber (`#F59E0B`), Sunset Gold (`#FBBF24`).
  - Messaging: ₹11,500+/month dignified passive income, zero intrusion, 100% control over house norms, ₹10k safety cover.
- **Language Switcher:** Global `en` / `hi` state synchronization across every single UI node from Navbar to Footer.

### 2. Verified Kanpur Unit Economics (Strict Formulas)

- **Saarthi Stash:** ₹300/bag/mo (Host gets ₹180, Platform Net Margin: ₹80 / 26.7%).
- **Saarthi Spaces:** Avg ₹5,500/mo (Zero Brokerage; 10% student fee + 5% host fee; Platform Net: ₹700/mo).
- **Saarthi Kitchen:** ₹90/meal or ₹2,400/mo (Host gets ₹55/meal; Platform Net: ₹16/meal).

### 3. Contact & Communication Routing

- **Primary Founder / Operator WhatsApp:** `+91 9369454350`
- **Investor Portal Access:** Client-side lock modal with secure key lookup; dynamic 1-page PDF Executive Brief generation on success.
- **Prototype Flag:** Toggleable global flag `SHOW_PROTOTYPE_TAGS` in `src/lib/constants.ts` for instant 1-click removal of all demo indicators across inventory cards.

## Operating Principles & Self-Annealing Loop

### 0. Mandatory Resume Checkpoint (progress.md)

- **Every session MUST begin by reading `progress.md`** at the project root.
- Resume work from the last checkpoint — zero context loss across sessions.
- **Every session MUST end by updating `progress.md`** with completed work, new blockers, and updated next steps.
- This file is the single source of truth for cross-session continuity.

### 1. Zero-Mediation Execution & Tool Reuse

- Check existing UI components (`src/components/`) and automation scripts (`execution/`) before writing new code.
- Always run `npm run build` after structural changes to ensure zero TypeScript errors or missing imports.

### 2. Self-Annealing Protocol

When an error occurs (e.g., Supabase timeout, CSS horizontal overflow, broken asset import):

1. Analyze the exact error stack trace.
2. Fix the source code and verify mobile/desktop responsiveness.
3. Test with `npm run preview` or test suite.
4. Update the corresponding file in `directives/` so future agents avoid the same pitfall.
5. Never ask confirmation for deterministic bugs — fix them immediately.

### 3. Performance & Mobile Guard

- Ensure all 3D transforms (`Card3D`), Lenis smooth scrolling, and WebGL canvases maintain locked 60–120 FPS.
- Disable heavy 3D mouse tracking on touch viewports (<768px) to preserve native scrolling performance.
- Root element must always enforce `overflow-x: hidden` to prevent horizontal micro-jitters.

# TestSprite Verification Loop

After a feature/fix, run relevant tests and inspect failures before reporting done.
Skip docs-only/build-config edits. Missing credentials mean unverified.
Honor the user's explicit choice of CLI or MCP.

## 1. Preflight and project

```bash
testsprite --version
testsprite auth status
```

If missing, tell the user to install the CLI or run `testsprite setup` respectively.
Resolve the project from `$TESTSPRITE_PROJECT_ID`, `.testsprite/config.json`, then
`testsprite project list --output json`; ask if multiple projects match.

For a local app with no project, start it and bootstrap:

```bash
testsprite project create --type frontend --name "<repo name>" --local <port> --local-host <host>
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --project <projectId>
testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port> --local-host <host> --output json
```

Local projects need V3 (V2-only: exit 7, `local-origin-requires-v3`). They skip
exploration; `test plan generate` is refused before charge (exit 6). Author plans
with `test create --plan-from` without `--run`, then run each id with `--local`.
Portal runs are blocked for free until `project update <id> --url https://…` sets
a public URL. Deployed projects retain `project create --url`; an empty deployed
suite can use `test plan generate --project <id>` then `test plan accept`.

## 2. Run against the change

Reuse a test covering the change or create one. Public `--target-url` must contain
the new deployment. The CLI does not build/host apps. For local-only changes use
`testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port>` (frontend only).

```bash
# Deployed frontend: create + run, or run an existing test
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --run --wait \
  --target-url https://staging.example.com --timeout 600 --output json
testsprite test run <test-id> --target-url https://staging.example.com \
  --wait --timeout 600 --output json
# Backend Python assertion
testsprite test create --type backend --name "Login rejects empty password" \
  --project <id> --code-file /tmp/test.py --run --wait --timeout 600
# Deployed replay (V3 FE: 0.5 credit)
testsprite test rerun <test-id> --wait --output json
# Dependency batch; optional --filter <substring>
testsprite test run --all --project <id> --wait --max-concurrency 4 --output json
```

- Local runs need `run:tunnel`; keys minted before that scope existed must be
  replaced if the CLI names it as missing (exit 3). Free-plan local runs work;
  a V3 frontend run costs 0.5 credit. Backend tests cannot use `--local`.
- `--local` implies `--wait`; timeout defaults to 1200 seconds, ordinary waits
  to 600. `--local-host` accepts `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` (default), or `::1`.
  A dead port exits 5 before charge; `--skip-preflight` bypasses the probe.
  Public `--target-url` rejects localhost/private addresses and excludes `--local`.
- One test per local invocation; parallel invocations are fine. `--all --local`
  exits 5. A user has 5 live tunnel bindings; `tunnel_binding_limit` is exit 11,
  not auto-retried. Stop an unused tunnel or reuse one with `--tunnel-client`.
- Keep the early **stderr** `Run <runId>` receipt, emitted after triggering;
  `Dashboard: <url>` follows when supplied. Stdout remains the JSON result channel.
- An **owned** local timeout, Ctrl-C, or polling failure cancels the run by
  default and closes the tunnel. Check the reported cancellation outcome.
  A run cancelled before it finished is refunded. `--no-cancel-on-interrupt`
  detaches instead, but the owned tunnel still closes and the run remains billable.
- Owned local timeout: start a **new**
  `testsprite test run <test-id> --local <port> --timeout 1800`,
  keeping `--local-host <host>` if used. `test wait` cannot reopen the tunnel.
  Ordinary/adopted waits can resume with `testsprite test wait <run-id>`
  while the target is reachable.
- `tunnel start` (no port) holds a tunnel in a terminal; keep it alive.
  Borrow via `--local <port> --tunnel-client <uuid>`; no automatic cancel or close.
  A second `tunnel start`/process using the same credential takes over; the first exits **10**.
- A case last run through a tunnel stays local: later Portal Run, schedules, or
  bare CLI runs are free BLOCKED (`tunnel-required`, exit 6). Use `--local` again
  or explicitly retarget with public `--target-url`. V3 local runs use the agent
  path, never saved-code replay, and preserve saved code.
- `--wait` handles polling/backoff; do not wrap it in a retry loop.
- Backend Python runs top-to-bottom, not via pytest: call your `test_*` functions.
  The sandbox has stdlib, `requests`, `pytest`, `numpy`, and `scipy`; use HTTP,
  not imports from the project's source or uninstalled packages.
- Backend `--produces`/`--needs` are repeatable; `--category teardown` marks cleanup.
  Set dependencies with `test create` or edit with `test update`; do not delete
  and recreate. Use `test run --all` for producer → consumer → teardown ordering
  and variable passing. A BE `test rerun` includes that closure and its side effects;
  `--skip-dependencies` selects only the named test. Triage failed producers before
  blaming consumers starved of their token/fixture.

## 3. Inspect and report

```bash
testsprite test artifact get <run-id> --out ./.testsprite/runs/<run-id>/
testsprite test steps <test-id> --run-id <run-id> --output json
```

Read the failing step, screenshots and root cause. Bare `test steps <test-id>`
means the latest run's steps; pin the receipt's
run id. An empty latest run does not substitute earlier steps; choose an earlier
id from `test result <test-id> --history`. Report the verdict and dashboard link.

Exits: 0 passed; 1 failed/blocked/cancelled; 3 auth/scope; 4 not found;
5 validation; 6 conflict/precondition; 7 timeout/unsupported; 10 unavailable;
11 rate limited; 12 insufficient credits.

## Dry-run and setup

`--dry-run` works without credentials:

```bash
testsprite test run <test-id> --dry-run --output json
testsprite test create --plan-from plan.json --dry-run --output json
```

Setup: `npm install -g @testsprite/testsprite-cli`, then `testsprite setup`.

**First-time setup:** if this repo has no TestSprite tests yet, seed a _broad_ first suite across its main user flows — not just one test — each with a concrete, observable assertion, before reporting setup as done.
